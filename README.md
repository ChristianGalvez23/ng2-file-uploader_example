# ng2-file-uploader_example

This is a C Sharp WebAPI 2.0 Project example of using Angular 4 with ng2-file-uploader directive.

This project only upload files. It doesn't have progressbar, doesn't clear the list (you have to refresh only), doesn't check for repeated files on server.
This was only for uploading purposes using the directive.

Regards.
